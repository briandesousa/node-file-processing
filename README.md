# Comprehensive Guide to File Processing in Node

This repository contains a comprehensive demonstration of file, directory and link functions provided by the built-in Node.js `fs` module. 

The `fs` module includes 3 different types of APIs (callback, promise, sync). Examples in this repository are built using the newest, promise-based API. There are a few examples of the callback and sync APIs for comparison purposes.


## Usage

Run `node index.js` to run all examples.

All files, directories and links that are generated by this script are contained in the `data` folder. The contents of the `data` folder is reset automatically as required. You can safely re-run this script repeatedly.

These examples are intended to be run in a Linux environment. While they can be executed in Windows, several examples will behave differently and even return errors in cases where the Windows file system doesn't support the capability being demonstrated.

This script has been tested on Node.js 16.x.
