  Comparing FS module APIs
  1) Read a file with readFile() from the promise API:
  content of ./data/test1.txt: Here is some top secret data.
  2) Read a file with readFile() from the callback API:
  content of ./data/test1.txt: Here is some top secret data.
  3) Read a file with readFileSync() from the sync API:
  content of ./data/test1.txt: Here is some top secret data.

  Working with files
  4) Open a file:
  opened ./data/test1.txt, the numeric file descriptor of this file is 19
  5) Open a directory:
  opened ./data, the numeric file descriptor of this file is 19
  6) Fail to open a file that does not exist:
  ENOENT: no such file or directory, open './data/nonexistant.txt'
  7) Read a file:
  content of ./data/test1.txt: Here is some top secret data.
  8) Fail to read a file opened in append mode:
  EBADF: bad file descriptor, read
  9) Read a file as base64 encoding:
  content of ./data/test1.txt: SGVyZSBpcyBzb21lIHRvcCBzZWNyZXQgZGF0YS4g
  convert base64 file content back to an ASCII string: Here is some top secret data.
  10) Start to read a file but abort the operation early:
  started reading file: ./data/test1.txt
  The operation was aborted
  11) Create a copy of a file:
  file copied from ./data/test1.txt to ./data/test1-copy.txt
  12) Create a second copy of a file and overwrite the destination if it already exists:
  file copied from ./data/test1.txt to ./data/test1-copy.txt
  13) Fail to create a third copy of a file because destination already exists:
  EEXIST: file already exists, copyfile './data/test1.txt' -> './data/test1-copy.txt'
  14) Append data to an existing file:
  file content before appending new data: Here is some top secret data.
  updated file content after appending new data: Here is some top secret data.  More important data.
  15) Append data to a file that doesn't exist yet:
  ENOENT: no such file or directory, open './data/appendNew.txt'
  updated file content after appending new data: More important data.
  16) Write data to a new file:
  'This data was written.' written to ./data/writeNew.txt
  17) Write data to an existing file:
  content of ./data/writeNew.txt before write: This data was written.
  'Rewritten.' written to ./data/writeNew.txt
  content of ./data/writeNew.txt after write: Rewritten.
  18) Truncate data in existing file:
  content of ./data/test1.txt before truncate: Here is some top secret data.  More important data.
  everything after first 29 characters truncated from ./data/test1.txt
  content of ./data/test1.txt after truncate: Here is some top secret data.
  19) Watch for changes on a file for 3 seconds:
  delete the watched file to trigger a watch event
  'change' watch event was raised for watchTest.txt
  'rename' watch event was raised for watchTest.txt
  'rename' watch event was raised for watchTest.txt
  watch on ./data/watchTest.txt aborted
